'runs' folder contains the run profiling information for TensorBoard.  
I just run 1 epoch since it took so long (1h+), but the essence of profiling it is the same.  
Then I load the custom python virtual environment and visualize the profiling data with TensorBoard.  

bert-training.ipynb is the BASELINE code without profiling info, and bert-training-profiling.ipynb is with profiling info
